##  Sentiment Classifier for Dell hackaton

The objective of this project was to develop sentiment classifier that would be used in real life situations.
This project contains a PROTOTYPE containing diferent models to be tested againd the data.

All project was based in a Kaggle. Kaggle is a online platform that hold lots of datasets and kernels to improve user´s Datas science knowledge.

## Model Development

* [Model Development Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hespozel/dell-hackaton)

The model development was all developed under Kaggle´s kernel environment. This was the most challenge and time consuming effort. 
This module was designed to run multiple deep learning architectures/models , over different evaluations methods with different embeddings and fully parametrizable, allowing you to record and compare results

Just fork this kernel and play around.You can select:
0) Read and Pre-Process Data
2) Convert Sentences to Machine Learning Deep Model processing
3) Run one or multiple models implemented. Each Model has a unique architecture
4) For each model select the rate between train and validation sets.
5) Select normal or Stratified k-fold implementation. Select the k splits.
6) Select batch size, epochs etc.
7) Model consumes Google Word-to-Vec embeddings in order to correlate word meanings.
8) For each model define the number of hidden layers, metrics, optimization etc.


Further development is needed to evaluate different methods and build emssemble results.
